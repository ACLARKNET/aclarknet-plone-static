Yesterday, with a tweet I announced the start of a new personal project:

Why?
----

I think about Plone a lot as it relates to my current professional work. So much so, I have more thoughts than I can currently keep track of in blogs, tweets, etc. So I decided to make an effort to write them all down.

You Can Help!
-------------

One of the things I think about a lot is what other people think about Plone. So I decided that this book will feature comments from readers in it.
