      <p><a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">`|image0|`_</span></a>Like many <a class="reference external" href="http://plone.org">Plone</a> developers, I primarily develop on Mac
OS X. Also, like many Plone developers I salivate over, and immediately
install any updates to Mac OS X that are released, including Leopard.
Overall, I have been very happy with Leopard, but there is one thing
that drives me (and plenty of other people) nuts: the automatic window
switching functionality in Spaces. For the unfamiliar, a common feature
of UNIX desktops is the ability to easily switch between many different
desktops containing many different windows. This feature is commonly
referred to as a &quot;desktop pager&quot; or &quot;virtual desktop&quot;, but Apple calls
it Spaces.</p>
<p>Spaces is a great application, they nearly got it right on the first
try. I suspect many of the questionable features were included for the
sake of soliciting new would-be power users, and/or to maintain
user-friendliness, but some features conflict directly with the ability
to &quot;power use&quot;. For example, if I'm running a Terminal in Space 1, and I
switch to (an empty) Space 2 to open another Terminal, opening the new
Terminal (e.g. via Quicksilver, or Spotlight) automatically returns me
to Space 1. I now have two terminals in Space 1, which is not what I
want. I then have to drag this Terminal to Space 2 which is easy, but
annoying. A much better approach would be to allow users to force-open a
new application window in the current Space.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.scsc.no/products/spaces-spaces-spaces/">Spaces.. Spaces.. Spaces..</a> *almost* makes this happen (via some
Dock + code-injection magic). With Spaces.. Spaces.. Spaces.., I can now
switch to a new Space and open a new Terminal window, without being
automatically taken to another Space running another Terminal. The only
catch is the Terminal application has to be &quot;in focus&quot;, else the old
&quot;wrong&quot; behavior still applies. In other words, switch to a new window,
then click on the Terminal icon in the Dock, then open a new Terminal
window. Not a bad work-around for my purposes, this allows me to easily
open as many Terminals on as many Spaces as I see fit without being
&quot;redirected&quot; (read: interrupted).</p>
<p>There are a few downsides: 1. You have to run Spaces.. Spaces.. Spaces..
as root, not convenient for starting on boot (unless applications can be
run as services somehow? Or something? :-) 2. I'd like the ability to
force-launch a new window for any currently running application in the
current Space without having to bring that application into focus.
Spaces.. Spaces.. Spaces.. does not currently provide this
functionality. 3. It is for Intel-based Macs only.</p>
<p>I *really* hope Apple addresses this issue in a future release, but in
the meantime many thanks to the Spaces.. Spaces.. Spaces.. developer!!!
If you are similarly bothered by this behavior in Spaces, I recommend
you give Spaces.. Spaces.. Spaces.. a try.</p>
