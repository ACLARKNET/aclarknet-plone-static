pyformance 0.2
==============

pythonpackages.com recently processed it's first official release via
the `new GitHub Service`_. `|image0|`_ As such, we are celebrating the
release of `pyformance`_ 0.2! According to the author `Omer Gertel`_:

    It's a straight forward port of Coda Hale's fantastic metrics
    package (originally for java). I don't have all of it ported yet,
    and it's not tested as much as it should be, but it's a good start.

    (BTW, if you do blog about PyFormance, you may also want to mention
    thisÂ \ `talk by Coda Hale`_ about metrics. He explains some of the
    math behind the package. )
