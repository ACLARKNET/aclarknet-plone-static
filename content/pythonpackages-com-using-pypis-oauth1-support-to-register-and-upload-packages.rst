***TL;DR** PyPI has OAuth1 support; pythonpackages.com uses it to send
your GitHub repos to PyPI.* Thanks in very large part to `Richard
Jones`_, the Python Package Index now has support for registering and
uploading packages via OAuth1. And using his `sample code`_ I was able
to take advantage of it on pythonpackages.com. The result is a fairly
**elegant approach to releasing packages** sans dirty hacks (I had been
asking users for their username and password, then storing them in an
encrypted session cookies so I could send them to PyPI.) Here's how it
works now.

Sign In With GitHub
===================

GitHub provides an easy way to let folks sign in to pythonpackages.com
with their APIv3. I was able to code the OAuth dance using only the
requests library (HT Kenneth Reitz). This was working as of late 2011.

Select a package
================

Once you are signed in, you can select a package. Selected packages can
perform various actions, one of which is **Tag and Release**.
`|image2|`_ As soon as you select Tag and Release, you are required to
authenticate with PyPI.

[STRIKEOUT:Enter your PyPI credentials]
=======================================

In order to get the beta out the door, a dirty hack was added to allow
users to enter their PyPI credentials. Credentials were saved in an
encrypted session cookie, then written out to .pypirc before calling
\`python setup.py upload\`. Really terrible. This was shipped in early
July 2012 and is thankfully no longer necessary (though it is `still
necessary to push the initial commit to GitHub.`_)

Authorize pythonpackages.com
============================

Now authorization can happen elegantly via OAuth1. First, sign in to
PyPI. Then authorize pythonpackages.com to act on your behalf. Lastly,
profit (register and upload your package). `|image3|`_ `|image4|`_

Register and upload your package
================================

At this point you are free to tag and release. `|image6|`_ `|image7|`_ Â 
I am really excited about this. I began fantasizing about it almost a
year ago and after several false starts (pypissh, openid, avoidance) it
is now a reality. If you have a minute, please `give it a try`_.
