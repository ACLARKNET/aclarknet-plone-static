After experiencing a negative reaction in #plone over my most recent post "Introducing The Plone Kitty", I have decided to leave the Plone community for good. I wish you all the best! It's been fun.

To be clear: I'll still be doing some Plone consulting as part of my "day job" at ACLARK.NET, LLC. But I won't be participating in any community events because it has become clear to me that my vision for Plone, and the Plone Community, is inconsistent with that of the majority of the core team.
