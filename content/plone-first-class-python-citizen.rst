*The Plone community and software fit nicely within the larger Python
ecosystem. Here's why.*

For almost as long as I have been involved in the `Plone`_ project, I've
been interested in Plone's role in the Python ecosystem. Today as I look
across the current landscape, I'm proud to announce a new milestone the
Plone community can take pride in. But the change didn't happen
overnight, so first let's take a quick look back.

PyPI support in PSC
-------------------

Circa 2008, Tarek Ziad√© and others finished the PyPI integration branch
of PloneSoftwareCenter started by Sidnei Da Silva 2 years before.

This was a big step towards the "Pythonification" of Plone, mainly
because Plone packages could now be published on plone.org in the same
way Python packages are published to the Python Package Index: via
"python setup.py upload". In fact if you are publishing Plone packages,
it is recommended that you release to *both* PyPI and plone.org
simultaneously. This ensures your package is visible to the most number
of potential users. And you can use `mkrelease`_ to automate the
process.

Collective docs at RTD
----------------------

Just when you thought things couldn't get more exciting in Python land,
along came `readthedocs.org`_ (a Django Dash production, IIRC). And to
`join the fun in July 2011`_, I moved Mikko Ohtamaa's awesome **Plone
Community Managed Developer Manual** to the `Github collective`_ and
configured the RTD `service hook`_.

This means that whenever anyone commits a change to the developer
manual, within a few minutes a new Sphinx build `gets published`_. It
was so easy to set this up, I wish I had done it sooner.

So you can that see over the years, we have been working ourselves into
a frenzy of Python goodness! And last week, it got even better.

Introducing: Plone packages!
----------------------------

Thanks to the good folks at `Cartwheel Web`_, makers of the fine `Open
Comparison`_ service, Plone now has its very own `grid comparison
website`_! (`Djangopackages.com`_ was first, followed by
`pyramid.opencomparison.org`_.)

This is a site where folks can add packages hosted elsewhere (e.g. svn,
github, pypi), vote on them, and add grid comparisons to compare
similarly-featured add-ons, frameworks, and other related software.
Grids are the killer feature of this site, and personally I've been
waiting to use them to answer questions like:

    **Q: What's the best blogging add-on for Plone?**

The content is entirely user driven (TTW only) so please head over to
`plone.opencomparison.org`_, login with your github ID, and start adding
packages! And while you are at it, please report any issues you find
here: `https://github.com/opencomparison/opencomparison/issues`_.
Lastly, let's all tweet a big thanks to `@pydanny`_\ and `@audreyr`_ for
their hard work and generosity!
