Plans
-----

I am planning to do some work on the plone.org server and website by the
end of the year, including:

.. raw:: html

   <ul>

.. raw:: html

   <li>

Upgrade to the latest 4.2.x series

.. raw:: html

   </li>

.. raw:: html

   <li>

Switch from xdv to `plone.app.theming`_

.. raw:: html

   </li>

-  Reduce the number of NGINXes running on the server by 1 (we currently
   have an nginx doing the xdv transform)
-  Repackage the current plone.org theme as plonetheme.ploneorg

.. raw:: html

   <li>

Clean up the server

.. raw:: html

   </li>

-  Separate vendor package configs from buildout generated configs
-  Remove archived files

.. raw:: html

   <li>

Prune tickets on `dev.plone.org`_

.. raw:: html

   </li>

.. raw:: html

   </ul>

I've done some of this work already, earlier this year:

-  `https://github.com/plone/Products.PloneOrg/commits/4.1-compat`_

Pitch

To ensure it gets done by the end of the year, I would like to add this
project to my calendar as paid work. So if you are able to help out by
donating some portion of the goal, I would appreciate it. Please use the
chip-in below to contribute to this effort.
